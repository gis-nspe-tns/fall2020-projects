            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Studies have been conducted by NYCDOT to determine the conditions that impact the quality of life and safety of local residents due to truck traffic volumes, congestion, pedestrian safety and air pollution related to the transportation sector. This research was conducted to determine if a known pollutant such as Nitrogen Dioxide has increased or decreased over time. The studies suggest improvements and recommendations that could benefit the NYC community especially in areas of high traffic concentration from the BQE. One area of focus within the city is Los Sures, known to be negatively impacted by multiple sources of transportation sector related air pollution. Adjacent to the BQE, the truck traffic from goods movement, to public transit bus depots, and through traffic have contributed to inundations of air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide is part of a group of gaseous air pollutants produced as a result of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion processes. Its presence in the air contributes to the formation and modification of other air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, as well as acid rain. This pollution emission will be the focus of the map study. The residents within these communities who benefit the least from the speed and order of transportation infrastructure and amenities in the area are the ones who have been exposed the longest and as results indicate are still being "worked towards". Understanding the prioritization of highly polluted areas through the use of several relatively recent traffic studies in the area in and around La Guardia park as well as NYC can be used to advocate for improvements in the area. This map combines census data and NYC-DOT Open Source Data to determine annual levels of Nitrogen Dioxide across NYC in December 2008-09, December 2014-15, and December 2017-18.</p>

A multi-criteria evaluation conducted with geospatial technologies across New York state yields the potential areas for the placement of wind turbines across the state. Applied boolean logic is used to identify the places not fit for wind turbine development, i.e. protected and populated areas. Once applied, spatial analysis to determine the most suitable locations using wind speed, power transmission lines, and slope. The resulting locations are most suitable for land-based wind turbine locations within New York State.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Urban gardens are viewed as a way to attain food sovereignty via creating grassroots community power and also help to make local ecosystems healthier and more impervious to the vagaries of climate change (Zubrycki, 2006). New York City has become thoroughly inundated with community gardens of all different types. Because community gardens have been spearheaded mostly by local organizers, their distribution across the Five Boroughs is not uniform. Current maps show that Brooklyn has a large number of gardens, while Queens does not, even those neighborhoods that lie on the Brooklyn-Queens border (GreenThumb NYC, 2020). To remedy this discrepancy in urban garden distribution across Queens, it is necessary to identify where gardens can be located based on suitable zones-- areas with grass/shrubs and bare soil-- and location of suitable zones within parts of the city that are accessible. Ridgewood, a neighborhood that lies on the Brooklyn-Queens border, is a cogent place to expand community gardens into Queens based on neighborhood demographics and adjacency to Brooklyn. Using QGIS, it is possible to determine what parts of Ridgewood can be dedicated to urban gardens. From raster data, it is possible to identify suitable land types. With vector data, it is possible to situate suitable land within real world polygons that exist on the ground in Ridgewood, such as parks, parking lots, and property boundaries. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change not only due to their concentration of strained infrastructure, but at risk populations. Vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the poor, and people with disabilities, do not have the resources or capacity to respond effectively to climate change events, whether they happen gradually over time or in catastrophic, one-time events.  This spatial analysis found that New York City exhibits high risk conditions for disabled populations in light of climate change temperature anomalies in this urban geography.</p>
