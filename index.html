            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In January, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first Disease Outbreak COVID-19 alert; later in the month,  the WHO declared the COVID-19 a global health emergency. Unfortunately nearly a year later, its still unclear when the pandemic will end. Globally, COVID-19 brought to the fore the importance of healthcare services accessibility. In Belarus, the healthcare system is under high pressure due to COVID-19. In accordance with official national data as of December 18, 2020, 169,648 people were infected; the numbers keep rising.  In total, there are 379 state-run hospital facilities in Belarus; and these facilities are under increasing stress due to COVID-19. Utilizing a GIS analysis framework and publicly available data, small scale mapping was conducted at the district level of Belarus in order to indicate which areas warrant additional medical facilities, and where it would be most suitable to site these facilities.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">As climate change persists, investments in renewable energy are continually explored by countries today. One such country is Barbados. The country is located in the Caribbean region which is known for its tropical weather and sunny conditions throughout the year. This project explores the geographical area of Barbados to answer the question: <i>Where are most suitable locations for solar farms in Barbados?</i> With one solar farm already in existence generating millions in savings, this study aims to contribute research as to where other solar farms may be located. Using raster suitability analysis, this project explores three criteria- slope, photovoltaic power potential and land use- to arrive at the conclusion that several areas in more than half of the island are suitable locations for solar farms.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The subject of climate change is indeed a defining issue of our time. Specifically, climate change threatens the livelihood and wellbeing of millions around the world. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world and also a country significantly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Bangladesh was chosen for this spatial analysis. Though there are numerous factors contributing to climate change within Bangladesh, this project considers spatial temperature anomalies and their relationship with population density, 2015-19. The results essentially confirm a positive relationship between the temperature anomalies and locations of human population density within Bangladesh.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Climate change and urbanization operate as stressors on our food supply. Urban agriculture is considered part of the solution to creating sustainable, food secure cities. In New York City, urban agriculture has been integrated into larger food security policy and legislation. Rooftop farms have other benefits than just food production; green spaces as such can help mitigate urban heat island effect, reduce stormwater runoff, improve air quality, and increase biodiversity. Urban farming is becoming popular worldwide, especially for entrepreneurs without any agriculture experience. This project aims to be used as a tool for entrepreneurs considering commercial rooftop farming business in NYC. Using a GIS spatial analysis framework, this project evaluates viability of rooftop farming sites in New York City.</p>

              <a class="text-dark">Refugees: Who hosts them? How should hosting responsibility be distributed? </a>
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The last decade has been a decade of mass population exoduses. In the wake of the war in Syria, hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the country and sought asylum in countries near and far. These refugees added to the numbers of those who had fled earlier and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As large numbers of these refugees made their way towards Europe, the European Union put in place hostile measures at their borders to deter migrants and prevent their arrival onto European shores. One of the strategies pursued to justify these measures was to label these movements as a “European refugee crisis.” The framing of these refugee movements as crisis was designed so as to insulate the EU from legal obligations towards refugees. The perception of crisis, created through incendiary rhetoric as well as the selective deployment of statistics, depicted Europe as having reached breaking point—demographically and economically. A similar rhetoric has been used more recently by the Donald Trump administration to prevent Central American migrants escaping gang violence from entering the US and lodging asylum claims. <i>But is this characterization of the high income countries being overrun with refugees correct? What is the true picture of the world’s refugees? How is responsibility for them distributed between countries? Is this distribution equitable?</i> These are some of the questions this project seeks to answer.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In a large urban geography such as New York City, waste accumulated from construction sites, residents, tourism, commercial and public land uses makes maneuvering within the city both cumbersome and frustrating. Additionally, with the inconsistencies of waste and liter management, many New Yorkers have normalized rat sightings. This GIS spatial study will assess 311 complaints via NYC Open Data to determine what are the frequencies of sanitation pick up and how residents respond to the rates of service. By using the missed collection and rat sighting complaints, these two varaiables are correlated. Results are thematically mapped, with the inclusion of a demographic dimension.</p>
